### 2. hideAndProtectRangesBasedOnWeeks

This script hides and protects spreadsheet ranges that fall outside the current week. It ensures that only the data for the current week is visible and editable, protecting past and future weeks.
This is my table set up for better visualization:

To run this code automatically every week, you must set a trigger. You can do this easily using the Google Apps Script web interface and configure it based on your flow. Below are the screenshots of how I configured my trigger:

### 3. Automated Weekly Data Transfer

This Google Apps Script automates the process of copying data from one Google Sheets document to another based on the current date. The script is designed to run on a specific day of the week (currently set to Sunday) and copy data from a specified range in the source sheet to the destination sheet.

### Features
- **Automated Data Transfer**: Automatically copies data from a source Google Sheet to a destination Google Sheet.
- **Date-Based Logic**: Transfers data based on the current date, ensuring the right data is copied at the right time.
- **Customizable Day of Execution**: Set the script to run on a specific day of the week.


### Steps
1. **Open Google Sheets**: Open the source and destination Google Sheets.
2. **Create a New Google Apps Script Project**:
   - In the source Google Sheet, click on `Extensions > Apps Script`.
   - Delete any existing code in the script editor and paste the provided script.
3. **Modify the Script**:
   - Replace the `destinationFileURL` and `originalSourceFileURL` variables with the URLs of your destination and source Google Sheets.
   - Update the `sourceDateRange` and sheet names as needed.
4. **Set Up Triggers**:
   - In the script editor, click on the clock icon (Triggers) in the left sidebar.
   - Click on `+ Add Trigger`.
   - Set the function to `main`, deployment to `Head`, and the event source to `Time-driven`.
   - Choose `Week timer` and select `Sunday` or your desired day.
